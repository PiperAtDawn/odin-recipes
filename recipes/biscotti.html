            3 eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon baking powder
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon anise extract, or 3 drops anise oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1 (9 ounce) package no-boil lasagna sheets, broken into large pieces
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup water
        </li>
        <li>
            ½ teaspoon crushed dried rosemary

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, beat together the oil, eggs, sugar and anise flavoring until well blended. Combine the flour and baking powder, stir into the egg mixture to form a heavy dough. Divide dough into two pieces. Form each piece into a roll as long as your cookie sheet. Place roll onto the prepared cookie sheet, and press down to 1/2 inch thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from the baking sheet to cool on a wire rack. When The cookies are cool enough to handle, slice each one crosswise into 1/2 inch slices. Place the slices cut side up back onto the baking sheet. Bake for an additional 6 to 10 minutes on each side. Slices should be lightly toasted.
